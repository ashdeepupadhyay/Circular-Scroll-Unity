# circular paginated scroll
These are the following characteristics of the circular paginated scroll 
- I want to be able to click arrow buttons to paginate through the carousel so that I can see all of the pieces of content that are available for me to consume. 
- The Left and Right arrows should always be visible to users on every carousel that is visible to them. 
- Each click on the arrow button should move the carousel by one "Page" of four pieces of content(in below example). 
- Clicking on the left Arrow should move the carousel to the right, resulting in the content that is to the left of the content that was originally visible being visible. 
- Clicking on the right arrow should move the carousel to the left, resulting in the content that is to the right of the content that was originally visible being visible.
- The carousel should behave circularly so if the user clicks on the right arrow at the end of the list, they should then see the start of the list again.

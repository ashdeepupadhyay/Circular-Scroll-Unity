# Circular-Scroll-Unity
These are the following characteristics of the circular paginated scroll
1)I want to be able to click arrow buttons to paginate through the carousel so that I can see all of the pieces of content that are
  available for me to consume.
2)The Left and Right arrows should always be visible to users on every carousel that is visible to them.
3)Each click on the arrow button should move the carousel by one "Page" of four pieces of content(in below example).
4)Clicking on the left Arrow should move the carousel to the right, resulting in the content that is to the left of the content that 
  was originally visible being visible.
5)Clicking on the right arrow should move the carousel to the left, resulting in the content that is to the right of the content that
  was originally visible being visible.
6)The carousel should behave circularly so if the user clicks on the right arrow at the end of the list, they should then see the start 
  of the list again.
